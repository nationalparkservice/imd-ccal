Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: 
    c(person("Sarah", "Wright", , "sarah_wright@nps.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "0009-0004-5060-2189")),

Description: This package takes water quality data spreadsheets (.xlsx) as 
    delivered by the CCAL lab and reads them into R, including all metadata
    provided. Data can be exported to machine readable CSV or XLSX files that 
    can easily be analyzed, imported into database tables, or added to an NPS 
    data package for publication. Also includes functionality to format data 
    into the Results table for inclusion in an EQuIS EDD.
