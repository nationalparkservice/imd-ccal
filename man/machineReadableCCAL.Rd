\title{Wrangle CCAL data into a machine-readable format}
\usage{
machineReadableCCAL(
  files,
  format = c("xlsx", "csv"),
  destination_folder = "./",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  concat = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{Path to .xlsx file delivered by CCAL. Use a character vector to specify multiple files.}

\item{format}{File format to export machine readable data to - either "xlsx" or "csv"}

\item{destination_folder}{Folder to save the data in. Defaults to current working directory. Folder must already exist.}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite existing file (Defaults to \code{TRUE} as with \code{write.table})}

\item{concat}{If concat is set to TRUE, the function creates one file, rather than one file for every CCAL deliverable.
By default, concat is set to FALSE, so the function creates separate files for every CCAL deliverable.
If only one file path is supplied to the files argument, this parameter does not affect the output.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing the data that were written to file.
}
\description{
Takes data as delivered by CCAL, extracts it, and rewrites it to tabs in an xlsx file or csv files in a folder.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get file paths
all_files <- use_example_data(file_names = use_example_data())

# Write to xlsx
machineReadableCCAL(all_files, destination_folder = "ccal_tidy")  # Write one file of tidied data per input file

# Write to csv
machineReadableCCAL(all_files, format = "csv", destination_folder = "ccal_tidy")  # Write one folder of tidied CSV data per input file
